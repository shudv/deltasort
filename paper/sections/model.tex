\begin{definition}[Update-Aware Sorting]
\label{def:problem}
Let $A[0..n-1]$ be an array of size $n$ sorted according to a strict weak ordering defined by a comparator $\texttt{cmp}$. Let $U = \langle u_0, u_1, \dots, u_{k-1} \rangle$ be a sequence of $k$ indices such that \[ 0 \le u_0 < u_1 < \dots < u_{k-1} \le n-1, \] and the values at these indices may have been arbitrarily updated, while values at all other indices remain unchanged. The \emph{update-aware sorting problem} is to restore $A$ to a state that is sorted with respect to $\texttt{cmp}$, given explicit knowledge of the set $U$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The above model can be easily extended to account for additions and deletions from the array-
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Addition:} For an existing array of size $n$, append new value to end of the array and add $n$ (the new index) to $U$. 
  \item \textbf{Deletion:} To delete value at index $i$, set its value to a sentinel $\infty$ that is greater than all other values according to $\texttt{cmp}$ and add it to $U$. Once sorted, the array size can be reduced by one removing the last value.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
