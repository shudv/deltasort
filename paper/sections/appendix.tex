\section{DeltaSort Worst-Case Movement}
\label{sec:appendix-ds-worst-case}

The worst-case data movement for DeltaSort occurs when all $k$ updated elements are moved to the beginning or end of the array (R..RC..C or C..CL..L where C are the values that weren't updated), resulting in a single large segment that requires shifting all $n$ elements. In this scenario, DeltaSort must shift $O(n)$ elements to accommodate the updated values, leading to a total data movement of $O(kn)$ in the worst case.

\section{Comparison Count}
\label{sec:appendix-comparisons}


\figref{fig:rust-comparator-count} shows the total number of comparisons as a function of update count $k$. We have used a realistic multi-key comparator that compares user objects by (country, age, name) to reflect practical comparison costs.

\section{DeltaSort vs ESM Crossover Threshold}
\label{sec:appendix-rust-ds-vs-esm}

\input{\figdir/rust/crossover-ds-vs-esm}

\figref{fig:rust-crossover-ds-vs-esm} shows that there exists a non-trivial regime in which DeltaSort dominates ESM both in execution time and space usage. For example, for an array of size $n = 100$K, DeltaSort outperforms ESM for up to $\approx 1K$ updates, while using only $\approx 1\%$ of the auxiliary space required by ESM. As array size increases, this regime steadily shrinks. For large arrays, the crossover threshold moves toward smaller fractions, indicating that DeltaSort loses to ESM earlier. Although both algorithms incur $O(n)$ data movement in the worst case, this trend suggests that the constant factors associated with DeltaSort's movement become more pronounced at larger scales. As a result, ESM's simpler linear merge begins to dominate for smaller $k$ as $n$ grows.

\section{Crossover Thresholds in JavaScript}
\label{sec:appendix-js}

\figref{fig:js-crossover-all} and~\figref{fig:js-crossover-ds-vs-esm} show crossover thresholds for the JavaScript implementation.

\paragraph{Observations.} In JavaScript, crossover thresholds are generally lower than in Rust due to the managed runtime's memory movement behavior. BIS and DeltaSort have almost identical behavior in JavaScript, while ESM maintains a higher threshold ($\approx 35$--$40\%$). This implies that for small $k$, BIS is preferable to DeltaSort in JavaScript because of lower space requirement and simpler implementation, unlike in Rust where DeltaSort has a clear measurable advantage.
