% Abstract
Sorting values or records is a fundamental operation. When records need to be read in a particular order, sorting at read time incurs repeated $O(n \log n)$ cost and can become a bottleneck in read-heavy workloads. A common solution is to maintain a derived sorted read-replica that is kept updated as the underlying system-of-record changes. For updating read-replicas that are stored as arrays, existing approaches rely on either full re-sorting or incremental techniques such as repeated binary insertion, which incurs high data movement, or merge-based strategy, which requires linear auxiliary space. In this paper, we study incremental sorting under a model in which the sorting routine is explicitly informed of the indices of values updated since the previous sort—a setting that naturally arises in systems that track update deltas. Under this model, we present \emph{DeltaSort}, a new algorithm for incremental sorting that occupies a distinct point in the time-space trade-off spectrum. We provide theoretical analysis and experimental evidence showing that, for random update distributions, DeltaSort achieves lower execution time than insertion-based approach while using substantially less auxiliary space than merge-based approach.
